# FirstGoogleProject

Hello! This is my first ever project on Github as I am making my way through the HTML and CSS Udemy course. I have just learned flexbox and I am just about to start flex grid. 

My goal is to get this course finished and complete many duplicate web pages to cement my learning. 

I haven't yet learned responsive web design and am aware the media queries would make this design more responsive. I am looking forward to getting into this more over the coming weeks. 

I uploaded the link for the page here - https://statuesque-tanuki-d96e3e.netlify.app/

I'm looking forward to looking back on this in the future. 

Thanks!
